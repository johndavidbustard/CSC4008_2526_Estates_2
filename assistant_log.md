## Assistant Interaction Log

This file records instructions provided by the user and the assistant's responses, in chronological order. You asked for a persistent log of any instructions you give and any responses I give; this file is the repository-backed log. I will append new entries here on each turn when you request logging.

    I'll create a persistent log file in the project and record this user instruction plus this assistant response; afterwards I'll append future instruction/response pairs to it each turn. Steps I'll follow:

    1) Create `assistant_log.md` at the repository root and add this initial user instruction + assistant response.
    2) On each subsequent assistant reply (when you ask me to log), append a new entry with ISO 8601 timestamp, role, and the full message text.
    3) If you prefer a different format (JSON, CSV, or a database), tell me and I will convert the log and modify my behavior.

    Notes / options:
    - Current format: Markdown, human readable. Good for quick review in the repo.
    - Alternative: `assistant_log.json` for structured programmatic access.
    - I will not record secrets or sensitive data unless you explicitly instruct me to do so.

    If this looks good, I'll append future interactions here automatically when you request logging; otherwise tell me the format or location you'd prefer.

    I updated `app/static/css/style.css` with a modern dashboard-friendly stylesheet, fixed CSS syntax issues, and updated `wsgi.py` to use the `create_app()` factory so the app serves static assets and templates correctly.

    I also added `docs/dashboard_development.md` with step-by-step instructions for converting the site into a dashboard and recommended next steps. Let me know if you'd like me to scaffold the dashboard blueprint and example chart endpoint; if so, tell me which sample metrics you'd like (sales, active users, property listings, etc.).
